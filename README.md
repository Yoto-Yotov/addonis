Addonis is a plug-ins registry web application. 
It is a new type of innovative technology showing the pulls count and open issues of the addon's repository on live time.
The problem that our product solves that it gathers add-ons for all types of IDE's in a single place. 
This is the right place to find the right tool for the user's needs. 

Some of the possible actions it enables its users to do are:
* Publish their awn addons
* Browse addons for their preffered IDE
* Download addons
* Rate existing addons
* Filter addons by tag
* Sort addons by date/downloads/name ascending or descending order
* Edit their own addons and profile
